# grails-bug-plugin-urlmappings

Reproducible example of https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/9706

Plugin `myplugin` is generated by `grails create-plugin` and not altered.
Changing default page in https://github.com/rlovtangen/grails-bug-plugin-urlmappings/commit/04a9c55d953cbb34d3c4443121388af0568a6f51[04a9c55] has no effect due to UrlMappings from `myplugin`

Comment out inline plugin in `build.gradle`, or remove `"/"(view:"/index")` from plugin, and it works fine.
